## 🎨 Key Transformations

### 1. Noctuary Editor

**Before:**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ← Noctuary / Untitled  ✓ Saved  🌫️ ❓ 📄  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
[Modern app header with toolbar]
```

**After:**
```
💀 (subtle, top-left)

[Clean, borderless parchment]

"Sealing..." (subtle, bottom-left, only when saving)
```

**Impact:** Feels like inscribing in a cursed grimoire, not using software.

---

### 2. Modals

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- Before: Generic dialog box
- After: Ancient scroll with parchment texture, wooden rods, wax seal

**Export Reminder:**
- Before: Standard notification
- After: Floating ghost with ethereal glow, pulsing animation

**Impact:** Modals are now memorable artifacts, not forgettable dialogs.

### 3. Language

**Before → After:**
- "Hub" → "Sanctuary"
- "Export" → "Seal"
- "Keyboard Shortcuts" → "Arcane Gestures"
- "Toggle Sidebar" → "Reveal Crypt"

## 💡 Key Insights

### Lessons Learned

3. **Context is key** - Show elements only when relevant
4. **Consistency wins** - Repeated vocabulary reinforces the world
5. **Trust the metaphor** - Users understand "Arcane Gestures"
