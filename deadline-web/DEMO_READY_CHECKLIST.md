## 💬 Pitch Script

### Hook (15 seconds)
> "Have you ever stared at a blank page, paralyzed by writer's block? Or gotten distracted and lost your writing momentum?"

### Problem (30 seconds)
> "Traditional writing apps are boring. They don't motivate you. They don't make writing engaging. And when you lose focus, you lose your flow. Google Docs is functional but uninspiring. Notion is overwhelming. And most writing apps feel like glorified notepads."

### Solution (30 seconds)
> "DeadLine is different. It's a horror-themed writing app that gamifies your writing process. Set a word goal, and watch your progress bar fill with blood-red intensity. Hit your goal, and you 'ascend.' The gothic atmosphere keeps you engaged, while the clean editor keeps you focused. It's productivity meets horror game mechanics."

### Demo (30 seconds)
> [Screen recording showing:]
> - Landing page → Onboarding → Hub
> - Noctuary editor with typing
> - Progress bar filling
> - Word goal completion
> - Export to .docx

### Call to Action (15 seconds)
> "DeadLine: Write more. Stress less. Stay focused. Try it now at [URL]. No signup required—just start writing."

## ❓ Q&A Preparation

### Q: "Why horror theme?"
**A:** "Horror creates urgency and engagement. The 'deadline' isn't just a date—it's a supernatural force. This makes writing feel like an adventure, not a chore. Plus, the gothic aesthetic is memorable and stands out in a sea of minimalist writing apps."

### Q: "Who is this for?"
**A:** "Writers who struggle with motivation. NaNoWriMo participants who need to hit daily word counts. Students with essays due. Anyone who wants to make writing more engaging. It's for people who find traditional writing apps too boring or too distracting."

### Q: "What makes it unique?"
**A:** "It's the only writing app that combines productivity with horror game mechanics. The theme isn't just cosmetic—it's motivational. You're not just writing words, you're 'ascending' from darkness. Plus, we have features like auto-save, export reminders, and keyboard shortcuts that make it practical for real work."

### Q: "What's next?"
**A:** "Mobile app for writing on the go. Collaboration features for writing groups. More export formats (PDF, ePub). Community challenges where writers compete for word counts. Integration with writing communities like NaNoWriMo."

### Q: "Can I try it?"
**A:** "Yes! It's live at [URL]. No signup required to start writing. Your data is saved locally in your browser, so you can start immediately. If you want to sync across devices, you can create an account later."

### Q: "How does it compare to [competitor]?"
**A:** 
- **vs Google Docs:** "More engaging, less distracting. Focused on writing, not formatting."
- **vs Notion:** "Simpler, faster. No learning curve. Just write."
- **vs iA Writer:** "More motivating. Progress tracking and gamification."
- **vs Scrivener:** "Web-based, no installation. Cleaner interface. Lower barrier to entry."

### Q: "Is my data safe?"
**A:** "Yes. Auto-save every few seconds. Export reminder at 500 words. Unsaved changes warning if you try to close. You can export to .docx anytime. Data is stored locally in your browser, so you have full control."

### Q: "What tech stack?"
**A:** "React + TypeScript for type safety. Vite for fast builds. LocalStorage for data persistence. Docx library for exports. Framer Motion for animations. Tailwind for styling. All modern, performant technologies."
