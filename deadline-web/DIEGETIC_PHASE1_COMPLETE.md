**Changed from casual to in-world language:**

| Component | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Verbum Dei | "Exorcism typing" | "Banish spirits with sacred words" |
| Noctuary | "Horror writing" | "Chronicle your darkest tales" |
| Profile | "Your progress" | "Your mortal record" |
| Settings | "Abjurations" | ✅ Already perfect! |

**Impact:** Cards now feel like ancient artifacts, not app features.

### 2. Navigation Component ✅

**Replaced modern UI language with diegetic terms:**

| Element | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Home icon | 🏠 House | 💀 Skull |
| Home label | "Return to Hub" | "Return to Sanctuary" |
| User label | "VESSEL: [name]" | "[name]" (simplified) |
| Sign in | "FORGE COVENANT" | "SIGN IN BLOOD" |
| Sign out | "Sever Connection" | "Sever the Bond" |
| Mobile user | "Vessel" | "Bound Soul" |

**Impact:** Navigation feels like part of the horror world, not a modern app.

**Updated all three states:**

| State | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Idle screen | 🏠 "Hub" | 💀 "Sanctuary" |

### 4. GrimoireEditor (Noctuary) ✅

**Rewrote all UI text to be more immersive:**

| Element | Before | After |

| Keyboard help title | "Keyboard Shortcuts" | "Arcane Gestures" |

| Export reminder body | "Don't forget to export" | "Seal them before they fade" |
| Export button | "Export Now" | "Seal Now" |
| Export tooltip | "Export Manuscript" | "Seal & Export Manuscript" |
| Gestures tooltip | "Keyboard Shortcuts" | "Arcane Gestures" |

**Impact:** Editor feels like inscribing in a cursed grimoire, not using software.

### 5. Onboarding (InvocationSplash) ✅

**Made the ritual more immersive:**

| Element | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Submit button | "Enter" | "Bind Your Name" |
| Skip button | "Skip" | "Remain Anonymous" |
