### Phase 2: Structural Changes (2.5 hours) ✅

#### 1. Removed Modern Header Bar ✅

**Before:**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ← Noctuary / Untitled  ✓ Saved  🌫️ ❓ 📄  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**After:**
```
💀 (subtle, top-left corner)

(Clean, borderless writing surface)

"Sealing..." (subtle, bottom-left, only when saving)
```

**Impact:** Editor now feels like a blank parchment, not a web app.

---

#### 2. Redesigned Sidebar ✅

**Added diegetic bottom actions:**
- "Seal & Export" button (moved from header)
- "Arcane Gestures" button (moved from header)
- Gothic styling with in-world language

**Updated button labels:**
- "New Tome Page" → "Inscribe New Page"
- "Build Mausoleum" → "Construct Archive"

**Impact:** Sidebar feels like an ancient index, not a file browser.

---

#### 3. Redesigned Modals ✅

**Keyboard Shortcuts → Ancient Scroll**

**Before:**
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Keyboard Shortcuts  │
│ ─────────────────── │
│ Cmd+B: Toggle       │
│ [Close]             │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**After:**
```
╔═══════════════════════╗
║                       ║
║   ARCANE GESTURES    ║
║                       ║

║                       ║
║  [aged parchment]    ║
╚═══════════════════════╝
```

**Design Features:**
- Looks like an unfolding scroll
- Aged parchment texture with noise
- Wooden rods at top/bottom
- Wax seal close button (red circle)

│ You've written 500+     │

│ [Export] [Dismiss]      │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**After:**
```
    👻 (floating ghost icon)
    
  "Your words grow powerful..."
  
  Over 500 words inscribed.
  Seal them before they fade.
  
  [Seal Now]  [Later]
```

**Design Features:**
